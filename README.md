# ThreatController (C++ Console Application)


A menu-driven C++ console application designed to simulate a basic threat management system.  

The program allows users to create, view, update, filter, and store security threats using a simple and clear interface.


This tool was built for learning, lab environments, and portfolio demonstration, following basic cybersecurity and software design concepts.

## Logging and Data Handling


- Threat data can be saved to disk
- Saved data can be reloaded on program start
- Helps simulate real-world logging and record keeping

---

## Purpose


This project demonstrates:

- Object-oriented programming in C++
- Basic threat tracking logic
- File input and output
- Console-based user interaction


It is intended for educational and portfolio use, not as a production security system.
